        According to research, data-driven art refers to an artistic practice
        that uses datasets to convey emotions and a message to the audience
        through artwork. The artwork is not solely based on the artist's
        imagination but rather on a core set of data and therefore the artwork
        has some truth to it because it is based on factual data. (Benzi 2020)
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike data visualization such as graphs where the data tells a very
        straightforward and apparent story, data art is not necessarily the same
        and won’t immediately make sense to the audience and therefore requires
        an explanation if it cannot be understood at first glance. To clarify
        the data that has been used and what is being conveyed and why? (Benzi
        2020)
      </p>

      <p>
        For my data-driven artwork, my aim was to embody what my data is all
        about which is make-up and therefore beauty. My initial idea was to have
        a data art that would somehow represent a facial structure, mouth, eye,
        etc. Because the makeup is highly directed and used on the face and
        therefore, I wanted to embody that idea through my data-driven artwork.
        I have encountered some issues trying to implement this idea therefore I
        have resorted to creating a scatter plot of colours based on the
        different types of products or according to their names. See the example
        below.

      <p>
        In his data-driven artwork above titled Together(2020) by Kirell Benzi
        this artwork visualizes the hierarchical positions of employees in the
        Havas group. The Havas group is the leading communication group and, in
        the artwork, it represents the link of all the workers starting at the
        top from the CEO who is then linked to the executives etc. (Benzi 2020)
        Even though I would like for my artwork to have links among it but that
        is something I can still work through and figure out how to implement
        and relate it to my data set.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to relate my data set to that of Benzi’s first data set that I
        presented Amicitia which reminds me of an eyeshadow palette and this can
        relate directly to my data set if I choose to use the data based on the
        different eyeshadows which usually come in a large range of colours.
        This form of data artwork enhances the data set as it embodies the pure
        idea of makeup and eyeshadow as being colorful and beautiful. Even
        though I don’t think it does much of a job to enhance the data that much
        but if looking at it from an artistic point of view and makeup is also
        being used to create art.
      </p>

      <p>
        It does however reveal a new way of thinking about the data because this
        makes out to be a more literal representation of the data as I mentioned
        above. As of right now, I am not sure in relation to what will my data
        be represented perhaps the larger portions of colour show the most
        expensive eyeshadow and allocate a certain colour for the most expensive
        and descending. Given the data set I am using, I want to try and convey
        the real-life essence of the data in it is makeup.
