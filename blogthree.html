      <p>Introduction:</p>
      <p>
        The concept of interaction has been a difficult concept to define in the
        field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) according to research HCI is
        the “multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer
        technology and in particular the interaction between humans and
        computers”. (What Is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)? n.d.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently a review titled “What is interaction?” summed up the basic
        interaction between humans and computers. Although this review defines
        the opportunities for enhancing interactivity with computer systems, it
        doesn’t show how these ideas can relate to visualization. Visualization
        researchers and practitioners are aware of the interaction concepts but
        not necessarily how to apply them to their own data-oriented practices.
        (Dimara and Perin 2020: 119)
      </p>

      <p>
        Interaction happens at all phases of the visualization process of
        turning raw data into views, the visualization community has worked on
        the representation of the data but has not paid attention to the
        interaction aspect. As of today, there is no concrete definition of what
        interaction is and what role it plays in visualization because
        interaction is a very broad term. To solve this problem, we look at
        interaction from the view of the visualization community based on the
        input of researchers and then revisit the view of interaction from the
        HCI community to see how the two views differ and how they are also
        related. (Dimara and Perin 2020: 119)
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the two perspectives, we then deduce a definition for interaction
        for visualization. The definition will aim to broaden the scope of
        interaction in visualization and is inclusive as it considers the
        perspectives of information visualization, visual analytics, and
        scientific visualization. (Dimara and Perin 2020: 119)
      </p>

      <p>A review of interaction:</p>
      <p>
        To capture the view of interaction in visualization, a list was started
        of papers based on the writer’s own expertise and expert input. (Dimara
        and Perin 2020: 119)
      </p>

      <p>Methodology Rationale:</p>
      <p>
        The topic of interaction appears a lot in papers about visualization.
        Stepping away from the “systematic review” and instead opted for a
        “critical review” that requires a more extensive analysis of the
        writing. And because critical review seeks out the most crucial
        concepts. Here is a list of three requirements: (Dimara and Perin 2020:
        119)
      </p>

      <p>
        1) Expert opinion must be included to fully represent the community's
        perspective on interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Using only the snowballing strategy (beginning with a set of seed
        papers) and elaborating using backward- and forward-references) is
        insufficient because the choice of seed papers distorts it.
      </p>
      <p>
        3) HCI articles unrelated to visualization are not permitted in the
        review. (Dimara and Perin 2020: 119)
      </p>
      <p>The Visulization view of interaction:</p>

      <p>
        We summarize the current understanding of interaction in visualization
        in this section using only the 59 seed and related papers that we read.
        (Dimara and Perin 2020: 120)
      </p>

      <p>What interaction for Visualization must involve:</p>

      <p>
        According to the definition documents, interactions must include
        external and internal entities as well as external and internal
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        1) External Entities: The user and the data are the two required
        entities most frequently mentioned. A user is a person who starts the
        encounter and can be identified by their skills, talents, expertise, and
        motivation. There is a difference between end users and designers in
        some studies. The user's primary interest is in the data, an intangible
        information source. A mediating entity that we refer to as the
        visualization system is the primary means through which the user
        interacts with the data
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Internal Entities: According to several studies’ interaction is a
        goal-oriented activity with a data-oriented objective. Goal tasks or
        difficulty are other ways to express intent. Intent can be used to
        define high-level data exploration insight development and the necessity
        to gather diverse viewpoints on the data
      </p>
      <p>
        3) External Actions: interaction can be seen as a dialogue between the
        user and the visualization system made of “action-reaction” pairs. The
        user performs an action, and the system will give an output.
      </p>
      <p>
        4) Internal actions: visualization system involves thinking from the
        user.
      </p>

      <p>What Interaction for visualization can involve:</p>
      <p>Can involve additional external and internal entities and actions</p>
      <p>
        1) External Entities: can involve physical objects such a mouse,
        keyboard, pen. Different modalities such as body movements, eye
        movement. Also involves the environment in which interaction occurs work
        such as at work or casual environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Internal Entities: makes use of the user’s prior knowledge, skills,
        abilities to interact with visualization systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        3) External actions: users’ action that can cause change to the data e.g
        filtering
      </p>
      <p>
        4) Internal actions: interaction can also occur in the users mind such
        as when they are processing information. (Dimara and Perin 2020: 121)
      </p>

      <p>Properties of interaction:</p>
      <p>
        Interaction for visualization is seen as an objective driven activity,
        which has the following properties: (Dimara and Perin 2020: 121)
      </p>
      <p>
        1) Granularity- which is made part of different levels. The first being
        the micro-level (mouse clicks) and the macro level consisting of (theory
        creation)
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Continuous vs. discrete – continuous interaction which is inclusive
        of transitional visualization states between the starting state and an
        objective state (e.g., mouse drags to perform a rope selection).
        Discrete interactions occur in a discrete manner (e.g., clicking on a
        box to toggle a filter
      </p>
      <p>
        3) Direct vs. Indirect- Directness relates to the incessant depiction of
        the objects of interest, quick, incremental, and reversable user actions
        which allow for easier use. (Dimara and Perin 2020: 121 -122)
      </p>

      <p>Benefits and critiques of interaction:</p>
      <p>Benefits:</p>
      <p>1) Strengthens cognition.</p>
      <p>
        2) Through interactive manipulation knowledge is created, experienced,
        advanced, and shared.
      </p>

      <p>Critiques:</p>
      <p>
        1) Interaction is hardly the focus of research efforts in visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) When emphasis is put on interaction then more effort is put into the
        engineering or implementation rather than the design of the interaction.
      </p>
      <p>3) Visualization systems are often not flexible.</p>
      <p>
        4) There’s little to no concern given of how humans can interact more
        easily with the system.
      </p>

      <p>What is interaction for Visulization</p>
      <p>
        Is the back-and-forth between a person and a data interface concerning
        data-related intent, involving at least one action from the person and
        an interface reaction. (Dimara and Perin 2020: 125)
