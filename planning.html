        For the static graphs, I want to implement two bar graphs one horizontal
        and the other vertical. To demonstrate the different ways in which the
        data set can be displayed the horizontal bar graph works better for data
        that have long names and the vertical one works more for those that have
        shorter names for what is being displayed especially on the x-axis. I
        chose graphs that would give the best display for the data and is
        readable and eligible to the user as well as easy to understand. In the
        assumption that the user has encountered bar graphs before and therefore
        would easily understand how to read the graph. The axis of the graph
        will be labelled accordingly to the names of the data displayed and the
        numerical values and a heading will also be provided to give context to
        the user to what is being displayed.

        Similarly, to the static graphs, the interactive graph is a horizontal
        bar graph but on this graph, the user will be able to interact with the
        graph. The user will be able to hover over the bars to reveal new
        information such as the price of that specific makeup product displayed.
        See example below:

        For the data art, because my data is based on makeup, I want to bring to
        life the idea of makeup and what it represents. For beauty, art, etc
        essentially the aim was to either have the data be set up in such a way
        that it would be able to draw or make a representation of either a face
        or makeup product such as a brush. Please direct to Blog post 4 for more
        information and other ideas.

        Although I recently stumbled upon a new form of data art on D3 and this
        one user data to create a collision of dots where the mouse acted as a
        collider and basically caused a repel to the dots when nearing them. I
        am not entirely sure how it works but it reminded me of the motion of
        applying makeup as well as the colors. The aim is to try to implement
        either of the ideas presented as all of them embody the data used on my
        site.
