      <p>
        For the static graphs, I want to implement two bar graphs one horizontal
        and the other vertical. To demonstrate the different ways in which the
        data set can be displayed the horizontal bar graph works better for data
        that have long names and the vertical one works more for those that have
        shorter names for what is being displayed especially on the x-axis. I
        chose graphs that would give the best display for the data and is
        readable and eligible to the user as well as easy to understand. In the
        assumption that the user has encountered bar graphs before and therefore
        would easily understand how to read the graph. The axis of the graph
        will be labelled accordingly to the names of the data displayed and the
        numerical values and a heading will also be provided to give context to
        the user to what is being displayed.

      <p class="subss">Interactive Graph:</p>
      <p>
        Similarly, to the static graphs, the interactive graph is a horizontal
        bar graph but on this graph, the user will be able to interact with the
        graph. The user will be able to hover over the bars to reveal new
        information such as the price of that specific makeup product displayed.
        See example below:

      <p class="subs">Data-Art:</p>
      <p>
        For the data art, because my data is based on makeup, I want to bring to
        life the idea of makeup and what it represents. For beauty, art, etc
        essentially the aim was to either have the data be set up in such a way
        that it would be able to draw or make a representation of either a face
        or makeup product such as a brush. Please direct to Blog post 4 for more
        information and other ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I recently stumbled upon a new form of data art on D3 which
        involves particles. For my data art I implemnted a canvas consisting of
        scattered particles of 4 different colours. My data across my site is
        all related to make up for my data art I retrived the API and specfied
        it to have an array of 4, the data consists of a list of 4 different
        eyeshadow pallettes from maybelline each of which I assigned a colour.
        Each of the products has a colour assigned to it according to its
        number. And each of those colours are present as part of the particles
        on the canvas. From first look the artwork seems like a constellation of
        different coloured stars. But I chose this artwork because it reminded
        me of what eyeshadow looks like when it spills on the outer borders of
        the pallette <strong>see picture example below</strong> which is usually
        black. And I wanted to give a more magnified look of that where the
        black canvas and background of the artwork represents the outer borders
        of the eyeshadow pallette and the small colourful particles represent
        the eyeshadow particles that fall on the border, representative of
        abstarct art.

      <p class="subs">Data-Art Exam:</p>
      <p>
        For my Data-Art Exam I wanted to give a more deep but similar experience
        to that of my intial Data-Art. For this Data-Art I implemented a canvas
        again but here the user can paint on the canvas using their mouse
        therefore making it interactive. This Data-art allows the user to
        imagine the data in a more literal sense the movement of the mouse
        depicts taht of someone appllying makeup or creating an artwork, and
        doing ones makeup is a form of artwork and makeup products themselves
        can be utilised in realife to create art. See Examples below:

        The colours from the brush are reprsentative of an eyeshadow pallette as
        the user paints the particles get smaller and whatever it is they have
        drawn is also gone. The user can move the mouse around and bursts of
        colour particles will appear with a trail and disappear as they get
        smaller and float around. The reason I made it this way is to show the
        temporaility, function and beauty of makeup. The colours show the beauty
        of the makeup, the blank canvas acts as a face, or surface one would
        apply makeup up on. The particles get smaller and disappear to show the
        temporality of makeup; makeup comes of very easily and doesnt stay
        forver and once its gone you are left with a "blank canavs". The user
        therefore can drag their mouse and create their very own temporary piece
        of artwork. When the particles get smaller and start to float and
        disappear they represent that of eyeshadow powder when it falls of the
        brush perhaps because there was too much.
        <strong> see example below</strong> The number of particles bursts per
        colour for PartcilesArray is equal to that of the data length from the
        API which is a list of eyeshdaow pallettes from Dior. >
