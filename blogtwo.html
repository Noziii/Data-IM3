    <main class="two">
      <p>
        Here I will be analysing my website’s UX and UI firstly let us define
        user experience and user interface. UI refers to the aesthetic design of
        the application’s interface, and UX refers to designing the application
        to make it usable and accessible. My website is a site aimed at
        displaying data on various albums and which is the most liked album
        according to research I will conduct. (Hannah, 2021) Now let us start by
        analysing the website’s UI according to a set of UI design basics and
        principles set out that should be adhered to:
      </p>

      <p><b>1) Readability and Legibility:</b></p>
      <p>
        This refers to whether the text of the website can be read and whether
        or not the user can distinguish between the characters in words. My
        website does not consist of a lot of writing although the writing that
        is there is both readable as the text is aligned to the left side of the
        page with line height and padding as well as a considerably large font
        size to make it more accessible to those who have eyesight problems. if
        placed inside a border. Therefore, the text has space in such a way that
        it does not appear to be squashed therefore making it impossible to
        read. There is sufficient space between sentences. The text is also
        placed on a contrasting background, therefore, making sure the text is
        readable. I have also considered the legibility of the text as the
        characteristics of the text can be differentiated from one another I
        decided to make use of the sans font range because the text is more
        legible. (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>2) Consistency:</b></p>
      <p>
        The site should make use of similar forms of navigation to not confuse
        the user. The site has consistency throughout its designs as the whole
        site is black and white themed with a splash of colour here and there
        provided through images. The navigation bar remains at the top of the
        pages making for consistent navigation. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>3)Shortcuts:</b></p>
      <p>
        I haven’t provided any shortcuts on the website that make it easier for
        the user to navigate, but I will be implementing “next” and “previous”
        buttons on my blog post pages and the respective pages in the design
        tab, so the user can click on that will take them to the next blog post
        or the previous one. As well as a “back” button that will automatically
        take them back to the home blog or design page. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>4) Feedback:</b></p>
      <p>
        The user should always be aware of what is going on and have an
        indication of where they are and what they are required to do. The site
        gives the user back useful feedback, in various ways when hovering over
        the horizontal menu the pointer will change to let the user know that it
        is clickable and the page, they are currently on will be highlighted in
        the money to show where the user is. Similarly, for the cards on the
        design page when the user hovers over the cards the pointer will change
        to give the user feedback that they can click on it. On the home page,
        the various album covers will display an overlay with the album’s name
        and artist when the user hovers over them providing the user with
        information. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>5) Reduce cognitive load:</b></p>
      <p>
        The aim here is to not make users think. I have aimed to do this by
        giving users very simple indicators that they would have previously
        encountered on other sites and therefore know how to use them. Such as
        the horizontal menu that most people that have visited websites before
        would know how to navigate through. And the use of icons on the
        wireframe page I made use of arrow icons that indicate to the user to
        press to slide to the next image. I avoid large chunks of information my
        home page gives a small brief explanation that doesn’t overload the user
        with too much information and is, therefore, easier to remember. (Maze,
        2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>6) Responsive</b></p>
      <p>
        This entails making sure the application is accessible on a large range
        of devices. My site can slightly accommodate smaller screens on other
        devices, but other parts need to be fixed such as the text and the
        borders need to become smaller when the screen is smaller. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>7) Visual Hiearchy</b></p>
      <p>
        This aims at telling the user what they need to know from the moment
        they enter the page. This can be done in various ways such as through
        size, colour, and dominance. On my site, the way o represents visual
        hierarchy is through size and colour. On my pages, the title of the page
        is represented in much larger text and is bold and usually at the top of
        the page this tells the user immediately what to expect from the start
        of the page. And on my blog posts, the title of the blog post is in
        larger font at the top of the page and in a different font style
        compared to the rest of the page as the title of the blog post tells the
        users what to expect or what the blog will be about. Blogs subheadings
        are written in bold and are placed in the middle of the page while the
        text is aligned to the left side of the page. These differences help the
        user to identify which information is important. The large text or bold
        text immediately prompts the user to read that first and if that is the
        aim then that is how you draw attention to important information. My
        site being black and white is very simplistic, but the small splashes of
        colour provided through images immediately draw the user’s attention to
        them which is what I aimed to do most images on the website have a
        purpose. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>8) Clarity</b></p>
      <p>
        This focuses on whether the site is overly designed to the point that it
        is unusable. My site provides the user with very clear instructions from
        the menu bar and any other buttons made available all with clear
        indications m of what the user should do and expect when they interact
        with the page. (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022)
      </p>

      <p><b>9) Accessibility</b></p>
      <p>
        Accessibility aims to make sure that the site is usable by people with
        temporary or permanent disabilities and attracts a larger audience. My
        site is accessible in a few ways as it makes use of headings that
        indicate what the user will be expecting. All the links are descriptive
        as each link is made visible to the user as to what exactly to expect
        when clicking on it much like on the menu bar that indicates each page.
        My site does not rely on colour to communicate information all text is
        written in the same colour. The information provided is easy to read as
        I asked one of my friends who has impaired eyesight to read the text and
        didn’t find any difficulty in reading the text and distinguishing
        characters from one another. (Maze, 2022)
