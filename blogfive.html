        In this essay, I will be discussing the relationship between data
        visualization, data art, and its approaches to representation. According
        to the text, Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics (2007)
        by Viegas and Wattenburg data visualization is seen as a means for
        representing data and information using visual elements such as charts,
        graphs, maps, etc. But because of its scientific origin, it’s been
        viewed as a tool for sense-making. (Viegas and Wattenburg 2007) Data art
        on the other hand is an artistic take on data representation, where data
        sets are used to express emotions and a message to the audience. (Benzi
        2020) But at the core of it, all the artwork is still based on factual
        setoff data. Through these definitions, we already see the relationship
        between data visualization and data art they are both visual
        representations of data. Data visualization takes on more of a
        scientific and straightforward approach to representation aiming to
        provide viewers with clarity on the information and data set provided
        giving them a better understanding. Data art on the other hand provides
        an artistic representation of the data set with no aim of providing
        clarity or understanding of the data set but rather to evoke emotions,
        curiosity, and questions from the audience like any artwork should. But
        an explanation is usually given alongside the artwork especially if the
        artwork is not straightforward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we understand that data art and visualization are
        representations of data in their own way and with different aims. Let us
        look at what representation is and its theories, representation is the
        description or depiction of something or someone (Oxford Languages). In
        the text Representation (2015) by Jenny Kidd the first chapter looks at
        the theories of representation. The first is ‘representation and
        reality’ in this part Kidd argues that language is the tying factor to
        attaching meaning to real life, that “language creates the concept of
        reality rather than reality existing before language gives words to it”.
        ( Kidd 2015: 20) Words therefore that are assigned to objects have no
        direct link to the object through the norms of society people are taught
        that certain things are this and do not question that. And these
        assigned words to objects only have meaning because one can
        differentiate them from other words because if there was no difference
        then there is no meaning. (Kidd 2015: 21)
      </p>

      <p>
        The second one is ‘representation and myth’ here Kidd looks at the
        concepts of denotation and connotation. Denotation refers to the surface
        level of something the basis of exactly what it is, and connotation
        refers to the representation that something specific has been assigned
        by society for example the denotation of a rose is a plant the
        connotation is romance or love because that is what it has been
        associated within society. (Kidd 2015: 23) In this theory of
        representation signs are assigned or associated with specific meanings
        on the level of connotation due to the way they are represented, these
        narratives created which might be false or not then can be described as
        myths. (Kidd 2015: 24)
      </p>
      <p>
        The third theory is ‘representation and visual communication’ this
        theory we look at visual communication such as images that are not easy
        to understand and can be interpreted in many different ways. Because
        signs such as images are not as easily distinguishable compared to
        written or spoken words the meaning behind them is often blurred and
        momentary. (Kidd 2015: 27) Machin and Mayr however offer a more
        extensive way in which people can view the connotative meaning of
        images. Stating that if the image is abstract the more apparent the
        connotative purpose surrounding it, the context in which an image is
        shown will sometimes determine whether the communication is meant to be
        connotative or denotative, and lastly that the connotative meaning will
        most likely be communicated by the artist in a way that the audience
        will be able to recognize such as global signifiers that have
        connotative communication understood and shared by most people. (Machin
        & Mayr in Kidd 2015: 27)
      </p>

      <p>
        The last theory we will be looking at is ‘representation as persuasion’
        here we look at the specific use of something such as imagery or wording
        to sell an agenda or convince an audience to believe something over
        something else. (Kidd 2015: 32) Through these theories of representation
        we can see some of the strategies of representation used in data art and
        visualisation. Such as with data visualization data visualization is
        often very scientific and therefore is more of a denotative form of
        communication for representation and visual communication. And on the
        surface of representation and reality data visualization has no meaning
        without assigned text being ascribed to it we would not know what a bar
        graph was unless if there was language and words attached to it and it
        can be differentiated from a pie chart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data art also makes use of many of these strategies or representations a
        major one would be representation and myth because data art has artistic
        purposes rather than plain scientific data representation the art is
        more likely to look nothing like the data or can be the real-life
        artistic depiction of the data. Allowing the audience to create their
        own meanings around what is being presented. Much with representation
        and visual communication, the meaning could be denotative or connotative
        such as the data art being based on a data set about flowers and the
        data art being a flower. Therefore, allowing the audience to speculate
        that the data set used could be about a flower but if the art had no
        correlation to the data set that could mean there is more of a
        connotative meaning to the work of art and that is where persuasion
        starts to kick in and the artist uses words to convince the audience of
        what they are seeing through explanation. (Mahoney 2019)
      </p>

      <p>
        For my own data art, I applied the majority of the representation
        strategies mentioned my artwork is very abstract and off the bat from
        the data set used, and in order for one to understand why I chose the
        art I had to explain it. Which I employed persuasion and my art has a
        large amount of connotative communication because the work is abstract
        and not pleasing to the eye. But I took my own turn on the data art
        based on my own beliefs and the way I analyse the data and its
        denotative meaning in real life. And in turn, assigned meaning to my
        artwork through language and words. Through this essay, we have seen the
        relationship between data visualisation and data art through their
        sharing in both being forms or representations the other more scientific
        and the other with more artistic aim. They are both based on a factual
        dataset. And the strategies of representation both apply to each of them
        but in a different manner.
