      <p class="sub">Fonts:</p>
      <p class="one">Georgia</p>
      <p class="two">Playfair Display</p>
      <p class="three">Open Sans</p>
      <p class="core">
        The reason why I chose these fonts is because they are simple and
        sophisticated which is the look I am going for this site. I styled the
        fonts in such a way that helps establish information hierachy on my
        pages. Playfair Display is used as a heading at the beginning of most
        pages, written in a big font size to indicate its importance and
        introduce the page to the user. Open Sans is a very standard font that
        is both readable and eligible; which is why I decided to make it the
        font for the main content of my pages and is stylized such as making it
        bold to highlight sub headings on some blog pages. Georgia is a slightly
        stylized font which is used for the figure caption on the design and
        data visulization page as well as for some sub headings for the blog
        pages to draw attention and point out importance. The site makes use of
        a combination of stylized and standard fonts the reason being that it
        creates a good design affect and makes it look charming. The consist use
        of fonts for certain aspects such as main content and headings helps to
        create balance throughout the site.

      <p class="sub">Colour Palette:</p>

      <p class="four">rgba(69, 66, 66, 0.318);</p>
      <p class="five">black</p>
      <p class="six">white</p>
      <p class="seven">rgb(216, 214, 214);</p>
      <p class="eight">rgb(227, 198, 215)</p>
      <p class="nine">#bbb</p>

      <p class="core">
        My site makes use of a variety of pastel colours, on the home page of my
        site the background picture is make up palette I made colour choices
        across the entire website to match the colours on the make up palette.
        Because the site is supposed to be a make up product store.I wanted to
        embody the essence of what makeup stands for which BEAUTY. The sites
        colours embody beauty and sophistication as well as being colourful in
        the most subtle way possible, the site itself looks like a colour
        palette which is the aim.

      <p class="sub">Other design choices:</p>
      <p class="core">
        Footer:I added in a footer so my pages dont feel endless
      </p>
      <p class="core">
        Buttons: I added in next, previous and back buttons on my graph, blog,
        and styleguide pages so the user can naviage tot he next blog page and
        next graph as well as the next styleguide page instead of having to
        leave the page. And when the user wnants to navigate out of the pages to
        the main page they just press the back button.
      </p>

      <p class="sub">Wireframe:</p>
      <p class="core">
        My wireframes have gone through a significant change from the start of
        the website until now. The website intially did not look the way it does
        now, I changed the website in order to fit the data presented which is
        makeup. Because I want a central theme throughout the website to create
        balance and unity I decided to change the look and some navigation
        components.
